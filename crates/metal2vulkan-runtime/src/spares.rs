//! A device's spare command pools and descriptor pools: a command buffer that completed gives back
//! the command pool its encoders recorded into, with the command buffers made from it, and the
//! descriptor pools its commands' sets came from (`descriptor_arena.rs`); the next command buffer
//! takes them where it would make its own. Made, used once and destroyed, a command pool cost 38
//! to 48 us and a descriptor pool 23 to 26 us on RADV (Radeon 780M), 7 to 8 and 3 on ANV, against
//! 0.2 and 0.02, and 1.3 and 0.1, reset.
//!
//! - **Command pools are kept, never released while the device lives**. Every command pool a
//!   command buffer gives back is kept, whatever its status, and every command buffer dropped with
//!   one gives it back too: the runtime calls `vkDestroyCommandPool` on a command buffer's pool
//!   only as the device is torn down, after its queues are idle.
//!   The spares stay bounded all the same: a command buffer makes a pool only where no spare of its
//!   queue's family is free, so the device holds at most as many as its command buffers held at
//!   once (Metal bounds those by each queue's `maxCommandBufferCount`), each holding what its
//!   largest command buffer recorded. Before, a pool given back past 8 spares, or one that made
//!   more than 64 command buffers, was released on the handler thread that completed its command
//!   buffer; on NVIDIA's driver 615.71.09 that `vkDestroyCommandPool` intermittently never returned
//!   (the driver spinning, with its own `[vkrt] Analysis` thread), so the command buffer never
//!   completed and its queue stalled.
//!   x86Sim RAM 5: a long-lived consumer's trim (`Device::trim_idle`, on its own thread) does
//!   release idle spares, as only a release returns the driver's memory (`Spares::trim`).
//! - **Descriptor pools are bounded.** At most [`DESCRIPTOR_POOLS`] descriptor pools of at most
//!   [`DESCRIPTORS`] descriptors together; a descriptor pool given back past them releases the
//!   oldest spares first, so the spares follow the shapes in use. The descriptors bound the
//!   memory; the count is set by a frame's demand: a window server's frame of 40 command
//!   buffers, 31 of a pass and 22 of a dispatch (host_ab's `drag`), holds about 53 pools in
//!   flight, a draw's needs and a dispatch's each opening a pool of their own, and under a bound of
//!   32 it made about 21 pools anew a frame.
//! - **Fitted arenas keep spares of their own.** The pools of the runtime's own kernels' sets
//!   (`DescriptorArena::fitted`) go back to a list apart from the command buffers', bounded the
//!   same way: a command buffer's set 0 takes any spare with room, so in one list it took the
//!   small pools a texture's moves gave back, and under a window server's command buffers a frame
//!   the fitted arenas made about a third of their pools anew.
//! - **A pool whose command buffers all ended is not reset; its command buffers are, as they are
//!   begun.** Its pools are made with `VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT`, and
//!   Vulkan: "If a command buffer is in the invalid, or executable state, and the command buffer
//!   was allocated from a command pool with the VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT
//!   flag set, then vkBeginCommandBuffer implicitly resets the command buffer, behaving as if
//!   vkResetCommandBuffer had been called with VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_RESET_RELEASE_RESOURCES_BIT not
//!   set". A command buffer counts the command buffers of its pool it ended
//!   (`CommandBuffer::end_raw`, every `vkEndCommandBuffer` of one): where it completed and ended
//!   every one handed out, none is pending or recording, so each is executable or invalid. A
//!   pool given back otherwise may hold one still recording, which the validation layer forbids
//!   beginning (`VUID-vkBeginCommandBuffer-commandBuffer-00049`: "commandBuffer must not be in
//!   the recording or pending state"): by a command buffer that failed or was dropped
//!   unsubmitted (an encoder never ended, a recording an error cut short), or by one that
//!   completed with a recording it left unused, as its encoders may (a render pass instance's
//!   draws its pass replaced before any draw, a refusal past a begin, a segment's core dropped).
//!   Its taker resets that pool first, as every taker did before ([`CommandPool::recording`]),
//!   and counts it (`WorkCounts::spare_command_pools_reset`). ANV resets a command buffer at each begin whatever its pool
//!   (Mesa 26.2.4, `genX(BeginCommandBuffer)`), so a `vkResetCommandPool` before the begins reset
//!   each one twice: on ms01's Iris Xe, ready to record again, one command buffer took 8.0 to 20.5
//!   us of thread time begun alone against 12.1 to 25.1 us after the pool's reset, three 24.5 to
//!   50.3 against 36.6 to 63.2; the RTX 5080 (615.71.09) 0.13 to 0.24 us less; RADV (Radeon 780M)
//!   0.04 to 0.15 us less for one and 0.16 to 0.30 us more for three.
//! - **A pool given back holds a secondary command buffer.** One that made none makes one as it
//!   is given back, on the thread giving it back, inside a section of the exit guard. A pass
//!   whose first instance does not record inline begins its draws in a secondary command buffer
//!   as it opens (`render.rs`); taken from a pool that had served only passes recorded inline,
//!   it would be made there, on the thread that encodes: on the M3 Max (MoltenVK, macOS 27.0.1),
//!   0 to 5 of a run's 4020 pass opens made one, 16 allocations each against 14. A making that
//!   fails is left to that open.
//! - **A settled pool given back holds a primary already begun.** The thread that completed its
//!   command buffer begins one of its primaries once the completed handlers ran
//!   (`ONE_TIME_SUBMIT`, as every encoder begins its own; recording nothing), inside a section of
//!   the exit guard, where no command buffer took the pool since ([`Spares::begin_ahead`]). It
//!   takes the pool out of the spares under their lock and begins with no lock held, then keeps
//!   it again, the newest: a taker meanwhile takes another spare, or makes a pool, and never
//!   waits for that begin (a wait on the lock across it was 747 waits of the guest's encoding
//!   thread in 255 frames, 11 us at the median, on ANV). The command buffer's gate opens only
//!   once that thread's hold goes (`command_buffer/gate.rs`), so it begins none where a thread
//!   waits for the gate: a waiter's return waits for no begin, but for one wait that came after
//!   the check. The first encoder of the command buffer that takes the pool takes the primary
//!   begun (`EncoderCore::open`), so the thread that encodes makes no `vkBeginCommandBuffer` for
//!   it. On ANV, whose begin clears the command buffer's state (Mesa 26.2.4,
//!   `genX(BeginCommandBuffer)`), that begin was 8 to 20 us of the encoding thread's time a
//!   command buffer (above). Vulkan asks only external synchronization of a command buffer and
//!   its pool, never one thread: `vkBeginCommandBuffer`, and every command recorded, "Host access
//!   to commandBuffer must be externally synchronized" and "Host access to the VkCommandPool that
//!   commandBuffer was allocated from must be externally synchronized". The pool passes between
//!   threads through the spares, under their lock, and is never in use on two threads at once, so
//!   a command buffer begun on one thread is recorded on another. Only the first encoder takes
//!   it: the primaries every other path makes (segments, continuations, a batch's barriers) are
//!   never the begun one. A pool whose taker resets it (one given back unsettled) resets the begun
//!   primary with the rest, which is then an ordinary one again. A pool given back unsettled, or
//!   while a thread waited, or whose begin fails, holds none. A taker takes the newest spare
//!   holding one first ([`take_command_pool`]). Counted: `WorkCounts::primaries_begun_ahead`, and
//!   those encoders took, `WorkCounts::encoder_primaries_begun_ahead`.
//! - **Descriptor pools are reset by the taker**, on the thread that encodes: the program's own, or
//!   one running the program's code (a handler).
//! - **Taken outside sections alone.** A section of the exit guard (a host step's recording on the
//!   scheduler's thread) calls only the guard's table of entry points, which holds no reset of a
//!   pool, and takes no spare: a command buffer or command recorded there makes its
//!   pools as before; what it made is given back all the same. A command buffer that encoded
//!   nothing, whose submissions record only their barriers, in sections, takes its spare command
//!   pool at its commit, on the committing thread.
//! - **Given back once nothing of them is pending.** A command buffer that completed
//!   (`CommandBufferStatus::Completed`) gives back its command pool and its descriptor pools; one
//!   that failed, once its work ended, gives back its command pool and releases its descriptor
//!   pools; one dropped unsubmitted gives back its command pool.
//! - **Released with the device**, as its teardown begins (`DeviceShared`'s drop, after
//!   `vkDeviceWaitIdle`): every command buffer holds the device, so none is left to give one
//!   back.
